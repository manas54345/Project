      <h2>Predicting Top 10 Playoff Performers 2019-2020</h4>

        <br>

        <ol reversed><h3>

          <li>Joel Embiid</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> The Process is back in playoff contention and is looking to prove
              something after last year's run. Joel is averaging 23.4ppg, 11.8reb
              and 3.1 assists. While the 76ers haven't been that successful in
              the playoffs as of late, this season seems different as the sixers
              have added more depth with Horford and Richardson. Look for Embiid
              to lead this team.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\harde\OneDrive\Pictures 1\Embiid.jpg" width="850" height="500">
          </div>

          <br>

          <li>Nikola Jokic</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> Jokic is by far one of the most versitile big men in the league.
              At 20.2ppg, 10.2reb and 6.9 assists, he has been improving his
              game vastly since 2016. I look forward to seeing Jokic and his
              abilities this season as the Nuggets look to make a deep playoffs
              push.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\harde\OneDrive\Pictures 1\Jokic.jpg" width="850" height="500">
          </div>

          <br>

          <li>Jimmy Butler</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> Butler has proved that he is a leader. Taking his talents south,
              Jimmy has averaged 20.2ppg, 6.6reb and 6.1 assists. Jimmy has a
              young group which looks very promising. I think he will be able to
              make a run into the playoffs and become a serious contender in
              the East.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\harde\OneDrive\Pictures 1\Butler.jpg" width="850" height="500">
          </div>

          <br>

          <li>Damian Lillard</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> Coming off an amazing playoff series last year against OKC, Damian
              has proved to the NBA community that he is definitely a force in
              the playoffs. Lillard has been on a tear this season at 28.9ppg,
              4.3reb and 7.8 assists. Portland has been able to make the playoffs
              the past couple seasons but have been unable to make a deep run in
              the playoffs. Maybe this year is different.
            </p>

          </div>

          <br>

          <li>Luka Doncic</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> The wonder kid is on a tear this season. Luka Magic has lived up
              to his expectations and exceeded them by bounds and leaps. It's
              unheard of a 20 year old averaging 28.7ppg, 9.3reb and 8.7 assists
              in his second year in the NBA. Doncic has displayed immense growth
              and I look forward to seeing him in the playoffs. While his play
              looks amazing, he has a lot to prove in a much different environment;
              the NBA playoffs.
            </p>

          <br>

          <li>Anthony Davis</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> A force at both ends of the floor, Anthony Davis is the definition
              of a versitile big man. This season, AD has been averaging 26.7ppg,
              9.4reb and 3.1 assists. AD now has a chance to make a deep run into
              the playoffs with a great Lakers team. The Lakers are the team to beat
              and Anthony Davis won't be playing around come playoffs basketball.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\harde\OneDrive\Pictures 1\AD.jpg" width="850" height="500">
          </div>

          <br>

          <li>James Harden</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> A prolific scorer who is capable of dismantling any defence when
              he is at his best. Averaging 34.4ppg, 6.4reb and 7.4 assists, James
              Harden is continuing where he left off last season. While his regular season
              stats are unreal, we haven't quite seen that performance transfer
              over into the playoff environment. I don't think the Rockets wil be
              able to make a deep run without a proper center and two ball dominant
              players in James Harden and Russell Westbrook.
            </p>

          <br>

          <li>Giannis Antetokounmpo</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p>After a MVP season last year, Giannis is looking to estabilish
            himself as much more this season. Currently, Giannis is averaging
            29.6 ppg, 13.7 reb and 5.8 assists; making a case for MVP and DPOY. Giannis' contribution has led
            to the Bucks into the top spot in the east. His efforts are unignorable
            but is lack of playoff prowess denies him the top spot on this list. Will Giannis finally be able
            to make it out of the East without Kawhi Leonard in his way?
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\harde\OneDrive\Pictures 1\Giannis.jpg" width="850" height="500">
          </div>

          <br>

          <li>Kawhi Leonard </li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> Coming off an NBA Championship, Kawhi is definitely a top three
              pick. Now in the West, Kawhi will have to face much tougher
              competition than the East. During the regular season, Leonard has
              averaged 26.9ppg, 7.3 reb and 5 assists. While Kawhi's individual
              numbers are outstanding, the lack of playing time with injury-prone
              Paul George may cause some issues come playoff time.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\harde\OneDrive\Pictures 1\Kawhi.jpg" width="850" height="500">
          </div>

          <br>

          <li>Lebron James</li>
          <div class="desp">
            <p> A perennial All-Star with consistent stats, LeBron James is the
              top pick this year. While in the regular season, there are many
              talented players, the playoffs reveal the cream of the crop. LeBron
              is averaging 25.7ppg, 7.9 reb and a career high 10.6 assists per
              game. It's safe to say LeBron is still a strong force within the
              league. Along with Anthony Davis, the Lakers will be a tough team
              to overcome.
            </p>
