Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a website which is designed around the NBA. Through this site,
I have made predictions about the upcoming post-season and next season.
Home.html is the home page for the website which is pretty general in
its introduction. Descriptions.html provides a prediction of top 10
playoff performers who will stand out this post season. Accomplishments.html
then compares the top 10 rankings based off their stats. Finally references.html
looks at next season and predictions on who will stand out.

Thanks
